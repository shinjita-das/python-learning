17. Write a Python program to get all strobogrammatic numbers that are of length n. Go to the editor
A strobogrammatic number is a number whose numeral is rotationally symmetric, so that it appears the same when rotated 180 degrees. In other words, the numeral looks the same right-side up and upside down (e.g., 69, 96, 1001).
For example,
Given n = 2, return ["11", "69", "88", "96"].
Given n = 3, return ['818', '111', '916', '619', '808', '101', '906', '609', '888', '181', '986', '689']
